        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> JUR Music</p>
        <p><strong>Justification:</strong> The name "JUR Music" reflects the personal and professional identity of JUR, an emerging musician and rockstar from Querétaro, Mexico. The simplicity and memorability of the name make it easy for fans to remember, and it directly connects to his music and artistic persona. JUR is an independent artist looking to gain recognition and build a fanbase, and this name will help establish that brand presence.</p>
